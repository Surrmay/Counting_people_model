Real-time Detection, Tracking & Counting using Computer Vision

## 🧭 Overview

People Counter with YOLOv8 is a computer vision system designed to automatically detect, track, and count people entering and exiting a video scene. It leverages YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) for object detection and Centroid Tracking for consistent object identification across frames. This project provides a foundational framework for real-world applications such as retail analytics, facility management, and crowd monitoring.

## 🎯 Key Features

- 🚀 **Real-time People Detection:** Utilizes YOLOv8 for fast and accurate person detection in video frames.
- 👣 **Centroid Tracking:** Implements a Centroid Tracker to maintain unique IDs for each person across frames.
- 📈 **Line Crossing Detection:** Counts people entering and exiting by detecting when they cross a predefined line.
- 📊 **IN/OUT Counting:** Provides separate counts for people entering (IN) and exiting (OUT).
- 📹 **Video Input:** Supports processing from both video files.
- 💾 **Annotated Output:** Generates an output video with bounding boxes, IDs, and counts overlaid on each frame.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- 🐍 **Python:** The primary programming language.
- 🧠 **YOLOv8:** A state-of-the-art object detection model.
- 🧮 **OpenCV:** A library for computer vision tasks.
- 📊 **NumPy:** A library for numerical computing.
- 🔬 **SciPy:** A library used by the CentroidTracker for calculating distances.

## 🛠️ Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Surrmay/Counting_people_model.git
    cd Counting_people_model
    ```

2.  **Install the required packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    The `requirements.txt` file contains the following dependencies:

    ```text
    ultralytics>=8.0.0
    opencv-python>=4.8.0
    numpy>=1.24.0
    scipy>=1.10.0
    ```

## 🚀 Usage

1.  **Run the `people_counter.py` script:**

    To count people in a video, execute the following command:

    ```bash
    python people_counter.py
    ```

    *   Ensure that the input video file (`test_vid_2.mp4` by default) is in the same directory as the script, or provide the correct path.
    *   The output video (`output_people_counter_2.mp4` by default) will be saved in the same directory.

2.  **Modify the input and output paths:**

    You can change the input and output video paths by modifying the `video_path` and `output_path` variables in the `people_counter.py` script:

    ```python
    video_path = "test_vid_2.mp4"
    output_path = "output_people_counter_2.mp4"
    ```

3. **Real-world use cases:**

    *   **Retail Analytics:** Track customer traffic in stores to optimize staffing and store layout.
    *   **Facility Management:** Monitor occupancy in buildings and rooms for safety and resource allocation.
    *   **Event Monitoring:** Count attendees at events and venues for crowd management.
